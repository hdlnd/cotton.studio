  <meta name="description" content="Cotton Studio is a space where art is not simply shown, but is born. A place where creatives come together to exchange ideas across platforms. The studio operates as a multifaceted meeting place of the minds. An artistâ€™s former residence for more than a decade, the now commercial space retains its demiurgic spirit rotating from gallery, photo studio, and showroom; to classroom, holding in house workshops on varied subjects and themes. Cotton Studio looks to bring the creative community under one roof where we can work and learn side by side.">
